Presenting my 3rd project, Slick Tiles, a 3D orthographic tile builder game.


Based on Unity Engine, Slick Tiles is a tile builder game, where players have to arrange or place tiles one above the other. Composed in an endless mode where players either beat their own highest stacked score or can go on endlessly placing tiles in perfection.

Placement of 3 accurate tiles, will increase the size of the next tile in the queue, giving players more congruent gameplay.
